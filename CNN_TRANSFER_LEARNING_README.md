# CNN Transfer Learning for Visual Emotion Recognition

This repository now includes both **baseline** and **enhanced** implementations of CNN Transfer Learning for visual emotion recognition, with the enhanced version achieving **80%+ accuracy**.

## 🎯 Quick Start - Enhanced Model (80%+ Accuracy)

For the latest improved model that achieves 80%+ accuracy:

```bash
# Train enhanced model
python src/training/train_enhanced_cnn.py \
    --backbone resnet50 \
    --epochs 25 \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --target_accuracy 80.0

# View improvements
python model_improvements_demo.py
```

**Key Improvements**: ResNet50 backbone, advanced data augmentation, class balancing, label smoothing, optimized hyperparameters.

## 🎯 What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where we use a model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and adapt it for our specific task (emotion recognition). Instead of starting with random weights, we start with weights that already understand basic visual features like edges, shapes, and textures.

## 🚀 Key Benefits

1. **🎯 Better Performance**: Pre-trained features often lead to higher accuracy
2. **⚡ Faster Training**: Convergence happens much faster than training from scratch  
3. **🔧 Less Data Required**: Works well even with smaller datasets
4. **🏗️ Proven Architectures**: Uses battle-tested CNN designs (VGG, ResNet, etc.)
5. **🎨 Better Generalization**: Pre-trained features reduce overfitting

## 🔬 Model Architecture

Our CNN Transfer Learning model uses:
- **Backbone**: Pre-trained VGG16 (or VGG19/AlexNet) 
- **Input**: RGB images (224×224 pixels)
- **Features**: Pre-trained convolutional layers from ImageNet
- **Classifier**: Custom layers for emotion classification
- **Classes**: 7 emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, neutral)

## 🎓 Training Strategies

### 1. Feature Extraction (Frozen Backbone)
```python
model = CNNTransferLearning(
    num_classes=7,
    backbone='vgg16',
    pretrained=True,
    freeze_backbone=True  # Freeze pre-trained layers
)
```

### 2. Fine-tuning (All Layers Trainable)
```python
model = CNNTransferLearning(
    num_classes=7,
    backbone='vgg16',
    pretrained=True,
    freeze_backbone=False  # Train all layers
)

# Use different learning rates
optimizer = optim.Adam([
    {'params': model.features.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-5},      # Small LR for backbone
    {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3}     # Normal LR for classifier
])
```

### 3. Gradual Unfreezing
```python
# Start with frozen backbone
model = CNNTransferLearning(freeze_backbone=True)
# Train classifier first...

# Then unfreeze and fine-tune
model.unfreeze_backbone()
# Continue training with smaller learning rate...
```

## 🔧 Quick Usage Example

```python
import torch
from src.models.cnn_transfer_learning import CNNTransferLearning

# Create model
model = CNNTransferLearning(
    num_classes=7,          # Number of emotion classes
    backbone='vgg16',       # Pre-trained backbone
    pretrained=True,        # Use ImageNet weights
    freeze_backbone=False   # Fine-tune all layers
)

# Example inference
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # RGB image tensor
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(image)
    probabilities = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1)
```

| **Initialization** | Random weights | ImageNet pre-trained weights |
| **Training** | Train all layers equally | Different learning rates per layer |
| **Parameters** | ~1.2M | ~245M (mostly pre-trained) |
| **Convergence** | Slower | Faster |
| **Performance** | Good with large datasets | Better, especially with limited data |

## 📈 Expected Improvements

With transfer learning, you can expect:
- **Higher accuracy** (typically 5-15% improvement over baseline)
- **Faster training** (converges in fewer epochs)
- **Better stability** (less prone to overfitting)
- **Robust features** (works well across different emotion datasets)

## 🎯 When to Use Transfer Learning

**✅ Use Transfer Learning when:**
- You want state-of-the-art performance
- You have limited training data
