# Dataset Balancing and CNN Improvements for Emotion Recognition

## 📊 Problem Solved

The original EmoSet dataset had significant class imbalance:
- **happy**: 25.24% (overrepresented) 
- **surprise**: 11.29% (underrepresented)
- Other emotions: 14-17% (varied)
- **Balance ratio**: 0.447 (far from perfect 1.0)

This imbalance led to:
- Bias towards happy emotion predictions
- Poor performance on surprise and angry emotions
- Unbalanced confusion matrix
- Lower overall model accuracy

## 🎯 Solution Implemented

### 1. Dataset Balancing (feature_engineering.ipynb)

**Strategy**: Moderate balancing approach
- Target samples per class: 3,967 (training)
- Method: Undersampling for overrepresented classes, oversampling for underrepresented classes
- Preserved proportional sizes for validation/test sets

**Results**:
- ✅ **Perfect balance achieved**: 1.000 balance ratio
- ✅ **All classes equal**: 16.67% each (6 classes)
- ✅ **Zero standard deviation**: Perfect distribution
- ✅ **Total samples**: 29,748 (train: 23,802, val: 4,758, test: 1,188)

### 2. CNN Model Improvements (CNN_Transfer_Learning.ipynb)

**Enhanced Architecture**:
- ✅ **BatchNorm layers** added to classifier for better training
- ✅ **AdamW optimizer** instead of Adam for better regularization
- ✅ **Improved learning rates** (backbone: 2e-5, classifier: 1e-3)
- ✅ **Enhanced data augmentation**:
  - RandomPerspective transformation
  - RandomErasing for better generalization
  - Increased rotation and color jitter
  - Enhanced affine transformations

**Training Improvements**:
- ✅ **Increased epochs**: 20 → 30 for balanced dataset
- ✅ **Better scheduler**: Maintained StepLR for stability
- ✅ **Separate weight decay** for backbone and classifier

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Balancing:
- Heavy bias towards "happy" predictions
- Poor recall for "surprise" and "angry" emotions
- Imbalanced confusion matrix
- Lower per-class accuracy for minority classes

### After Balancing + Model Improvements:
- 🎯 **Unbiased predictions** across all emotions
- 🎯 **Improved recall** for previously underrepresented classes
- 🎯 **Balanced confusion matrix** with better diagonal values
- 🎯 **Higher overall accuracy** and F1-scores
- 🎯 **Faster convergence** with BatchNorm
- 🎯 **Better generalization** with enhanced augmentation

## 🔍 Key Metrics to Monitor

When training the improved model, watch for:
- **Balanced per-class accuracy** (all emotions should perform similarly)
- **Improved confusion matrix** (stronger diagonal, less bias)
- **Higher F1-scores** for previously underrepresented classes
- **Faster convergence** due to balanced data and BatchNorm
- **Better validation accuracy** with reduced overfitting

## 🎉 Expected Benefits

1. **Fairer emotion recognition** across all classes
2. **Production-ready model** without bias issues  
3. **Better real-world performance** on diverse emotions
4. **Improved user experience** in applications
5. **Scientific validity** with balanced evaluation

The balanced dataset and improved CNN model should deliver significantly better performance for emotion recognition tasks!
